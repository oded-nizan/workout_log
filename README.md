Currently, the app has a user database and allows users to create workout programs and edit them as well as print them.
I might add, in the future, the option to log data of applying your workouts to the app and have it analyze and report it to you.
There are example json files in the src code for reference
Update for my large amount of clients using this app, I have completed a version of the app that allows for data log of actual 
workouts but just like the first version of the app it has not been tested yet.
Also, it is stored in a different directory and I believe it is best practice to delete the directory of the version you will not be using.
